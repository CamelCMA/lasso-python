What is Diffcrash?
``````````````````

    Diffcrash_ is a software from Sidact_ which is designed
    for robustness analysis of simulation runs. It can be used as 
    a set of independent executables or as a postprocessor plugin.
    Diffcrash_ itself must be licensed. Please therefore contact either
    Sidact_ directly or LASSO_. This commmand line utility makes 
    running a Diffcrash analysis much easier.

How to use the utility?
```````````````````````

    You can get the run info by performing:

    ::

        python -m lasso.diffcrash.run --help
        
           ==== D I F F C R A S H ====  

         a LASSO GmbH utility script.

        usage: run.py [-h] --reference-run REFERENCE_RUN --crash-code CRASH_CODE
                    [--diffcrash-home [DIFFCRASH_HOME]]
                    [--use-id-mapping [USE_ID_MAPPING]]
                    [--project-dir [PROJECT_DIR]] [--config-file [CONFIG_FILE]]
                    [--parameter-file [PARAMETER_FILE]]
                    [--n-processes [N_PROCESSES]]
                    [simulation_runs [simulation_runs ...]]

        Python utility script for Diffcrash written by LASSO GmbH.

        positional arguments:
        simulation_runs       Simulation runs or patterns used to search for
                                simulation runs.

        optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        --reference-run REFERENCE_RUN
                                filepath of the reference run.
        --crash-code CRASH_CODE
                                Which crash code is used ('dyna', 'pam' or 'radioss').
        --diffcrash-home [DIFFCRASH_HOME]
                                Home directory where Diffcrash is installed. Uses
                                environment variable 'DIFFCRASHHOME' if unspecified.
        --use-id-mapping [USE_ID_MAPPING]
                                Whether to use id-based mapping (default is nearest
                                neighbour).
        --project-dir [PROJECT_DIR]
                                Project dir to use for femzip.
        --config-file [CONFIG_FILE]
                                Path to the config file.
        --parameter-file [PARAMETER_FILE]
                                Path to the parameter file.
        --n-processes [N_PROCESSES]
                                Number of processes to use (default: max-1)

    It is important to specify a `--reference-run` for the analysis. 
    If the reference run is contained within the rest of the 
    `simulation_runs`, it is automatically removed from that list. 
    `simulation_runs` can be either tagged individually or by using 
    placeholders for entire directories (e.g. '\*.fz') and 
    subdirectories (e.g. '/\*\*/\*.fz').

    .. WARNING::
        Every run clears the project directory entirely!

Example
```````

    ::

        python -m lasso.diffcrash.run
            --reference-run ./runs/run_1.fz 
            --crash-code dyna 
            --project-dir diffcrash_project  
            ./runs/*.fz
